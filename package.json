    "description": "AWS Resource Groups AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as\nAmazon EC2 instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, and Amazon\nS3 buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group\nis a collection of resources that match the resource types specified in a query,\nand share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of\nresources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages,\nregions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource groups enable\nyou to automate management tasks, such as those in AWS Systems Manager\nAutomation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS Systems Manager. Groups of\ntagged resources also let you quickly view a custom console in AWS Systems\nManager that shows AWS Config compliance and other monitoring data about member\nresources.\n\nTo create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that\nidentify the criteria that members of the group have in common. Tags are\nkey-value pairs.\n\nFor more information about Resource Groups, see the AWS Resource Groups User\nGuide [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html].\n\nAWS Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the\nfollowing types of operations.\n\n *  Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups and\n   resource query entities\n   \n   \n *  Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups\n   \n   \n *  Resolving resource group member ARNs so they can be returned as search\n   results\n   \n   \n *  Getting data about resources that are members of a group\n   \n   \n *  Searching AWS resources based on a resource query",
